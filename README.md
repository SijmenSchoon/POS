# POS
Well, this is POS. It stands for POS Operating System, which in turn stands
for Piece Of S*** Operating System. No recursive acronyms this time!

Most of the current code is taken, or at least highly inspired by the tutorial
''Meaty Skeleton'' on wiki.osdev.org. After this, I'll probably branch off more.
Or not. Last time I tried the project completely failed, so I guess I'll do what
people with more experience than me did this time.
